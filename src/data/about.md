# Intro

I consider myself something in between of a Computer Engineer and a Political Scientist. Therefore, I am passionate about building models to understand our world, more speficically our social interactions and political phenomena. Throughout my life, my passion for technology, politics and service have guided my actions and choices. In this page, there is a summary of some of those passions and activities, but I am always open to discuss more about them in person.

# Some History

Since I was little, I have always been drawn to technology. It all started with my very old parents' computers, which I had access to thanks to their jobs in the oil industry. Moreover, wherever there was a computer, I installed video games. I still remember playing Test Drive on my grandpa's old i486. Growing up in Venezuela, I noticed that despite having a normal childhood as any other middle-class kid, our country and our political system was going the wrong way. In 1998, I was 13 years old when Chávez was elected for the first time as president of Venezuela. That is when things started going really bad, with a lot of effort while engaging in political activism as a student, I graduated as a Computer Engineer from [USB](http://usb.ve/), but felt I needed to do more. I started a master's degree in political science at my alma mater that I could not finish because of the political and economical situation of my country. Thanks to Dr. Iñaki Sagarzazu, I knew about Texas Tech University, they offered me a really good oportunity to pursue my MA and PhD degree's. I always will be grateful to Dr. Alissandra Stoyan, my dissertation advisor, for their kindness, mentorship, and knowledge during the period I was writing my dissertation; I have no doubt that with her at my side I managed to obtain my PhD degree. The situation in my country has not improved since I arrived to the US in 2018, but I am determined to contribute in any way that I can with the training I received as a political scientist. My research is motivated by my normative believe that everybody has the right to democracy and freedom, especially in countries suffering humanitarian crises. I craft models to understand authoritarian dynamics, gender inequalities, elections patterns, and institutional designs. My main region of study is Latin American, but have collaborated and studied other regions of the world as well. Thanks to my cross-disciplinary training, I have been able to import methods from computer science into political science research, this also gave me the opportunity to mentor undergraduate and graduate research. 

# Service and causes

Along technology and politics, serving others is one of my major passions. From 2008 to 2012, I served as ambassador for [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), I attended events as a spokeperson and open software activist, mainly launch parties and installation festivals. In my alma mater, I served as a Volunteer Forest Ranger from 2011, to 2015, where I participaed in reforestation and forest protection, tours for visitors, and volunteered at institutional support activities. Finally, after graduating, I continued helping my alma mater as part of the team at the [USB Alumni Association of America, Inc.](https://alumnusb.org/), a non-profit organization that has collected over 945,000 dollars since its foundation back in 2015, and handed over 65 students scholarhips and 200 professors awards. Previously, during my undergarduate years at [USB](http://usb.ve/), I served as a Student Representatiev at FONDESIBO (a Student's Aid Fund); a Student Delegate at the Unievrsity's Assembly; and finally, I was the Substitute President of the Student Electoral Comission of the Student's Federation. In all of these roles I always represented my peers' needs of a fair and just education and services. More recently, at [TTU](https://ttu.edu/), I served as Treasurer of the Graduate Assemly (GA); Treasurer and Founder of the Venezuelan Student Association (VSA-TTU); and finally, I was a Senator representing the Graduate School at the Student Government Association (SGA-TTU).

# Fun Facts

- I have been living for six years and half in the US without a car. That's right, only using a bycicle.
- The favicon of this site is Dr. Manhattan's logo from Watchment, I believe it captures both my minimalistic nature and my passion for science.
- Thanks to research conferences, friends, and family, I visited 20 states of the US, still less than half.
- I am team Summer, so I will always prefer warm over cold weather.
- I know the numbers in Korean because I practiced Tae Kwon Do when I was little.
